class Model(CostedConstraintSet):
    """Symbolic representation of an optimization problem.

    The Model class is used both directly to create models with constants and
    sweeps, and indirectly inherited to create custom model classes.

    Arguments
    ---------
    cost : Posynomial (optional)
        Defaults to `Monomial(1)`.

    constraints : ConstraintSet or list of constraints (optional)
        Defaults to an empty list.

    substitutions : dict (optional)
        This dictionary will be substituted into the problem before solving,
        and also allows the declaration of sweeps and linked sweeps.

    name : str (optional)
        Allows "naming" a model in a way similar to inherited instances,
        and overrides the inherited name if there is one.

    Attributes with side effects
    ----------------------------
    `program` is set during a solve
    `solution` is set at the end of a solve
