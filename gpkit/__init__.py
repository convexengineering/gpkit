GPkit is now installed with solver(s) %s
To incorporate new solvers at a later date, run `gpkit.build()`.

If any tests didn't pass, please post the output above
(starting from "Found no installed solvers, beginning a build.")
to gpkit@mit.edu or https://github.com/convexengineering/gpkit/issues/new
so we can prevent others from having these errors.

The same goes for any other bugs you encounter with GPkit:
send 'em our way, along with any interesting models, speculative features,
comments, discussions, or clarifications you feel like sharing.

Finally, we hope you find our documentation (https://gpkit.readthedocs.io/)
and engineering-design models (https://github.com/convexengineering/gplibrary/)
to be useful resources for your own applications.

Enjoy!
