Build failed!  :(

You may need to install a solver and then `import gpkit` again;
see https://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
for troubleshooting details.

But before you go, please post the output above
(starting from "Found no installed solvers, beginning a build.")
to gpkit@mit.edu or https://github.com/convexengineering/gpkit/issues/new
so we can prevent others from having to see this message.

        Thanks!  :)
