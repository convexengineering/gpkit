Installation Instructions
*********************

If you encounter bugs during installation email ``gpkit@mit.edu``,
or `raise a new issue <http://github.com/hoburg/gpkit/issues/new>`_.


Install dependencies
====================
GPkit's dependencies are the python packages

- ``pip``
- ``numpy`` version 1.8 or newer
- ``scipy``
- ``pint``

and at least one solver (which we will install in a later step).

There are many ways to install these dependencies.
Below is one suggestion for how to do so.

Get ``pip``
-----------

Mac OS X
    Run ``easy_install pip`` at a terminal window.
Linux
    Use your package manager to install ``pip``
        Ubuntu: ``sudo apt-get install python-pip``
Windows
    Do nothing at this step.

Get python packages
-------------------

Mac OS X
    Run the following commands:
      - ``pip install pip --upgrade``
      - ``pip install numpy``
      - ``pip install scipy``
      - ``pip install pint``

Linux
    Use your package manager to install ``numpy`` and ``scipy``
        Ubuntu: ``sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy``
    Run ``pip install pint``

Windows
    Do nothing at this step.


Install a GP solver
===================
GPkit interfaces with two off the shelf solvers: cvxopt, and mosek.
Cvxopt is open source; mosek requires a commercial licence or (free)
academic license.

At least one solver is required.

Unfortunately, on Windows, due to 32-bit vs 64 bit issues, we do not
currently know of a way to install both cvxopt and mosek simultaneously.
If you are a Windows user, you should pick one solver or the other.
For Windows 10, cvxopt does not appear to be an option.

Installing cvxopt
-----------------

Mac OSX and Linux
    Run ``pip install cvxopt``
    
    If experiencing issues with wheel in Ubuntu 16.04, try the `official installer. <http://cvxopt.org/install/index.html>`_

Windows
    If you are using Windows 10, stop. Go to `Installing mosek`_.

    Install the Python 2.7 version of `Python (x,y) <https://python-xy.github.io/downloads.html>`_ (note that Python (x,y) is 32-bit)
      - Installing CVXOPT with Anaconda or another Python distribution can be difficult, which is why we recommend Python (x,y).
      - Python (x,y) recommends removing any previous installations of Python before installation.
      - Be sure to click the cvxopt and pint check boxes under "Choose components" during installation.

Installing mosek
----------------

Note: if you do not have a paid license,
you will need an academic or trial license to proceed.

Mac OS X
  - If ``which gcc`` does not return anything, install ``XCode`` and the `Apple Command Line Tools <https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=command%20line%20tools>`_.
  - Install cytypesgen via ``pip install ctypesgen --pre`` (gpkit uses ctypesgen to interface with the MOSEK C bindings).
  - Download `MOSEK <http://mosek.com/resources/downloads>`_, then:
      - Move the ``mosek`` folder to your home directory
      - Follow `these steps for Mac <http://docs.mosek.com/7.0/toolsinstall/Mac_OS_X_installation.html>`_.
      - Request an `academic license file <http://license.mosek.com/academic>`_ and put it in ``~/mosek/``

Linux
  - Install cytypesgen via ``pip install ctypesgen --pre`` (gpkit uses ctypesgen to interface with the MOSEK C bindings).
  - Download `MOSEK <http://mosek.com/resources/downloads>`_, then:
      - Move the ``mosek`` folder to your home directory
      - Follow `these steps for Linux <http://docs.mosek.com/7.0/toolsinstall/Linux_UNIX_installation_instructions.html>`_.
      - Request an `academic license file <http://license.mosek.com/academic>`_ and put it in ``~/mosek/``

Windows
    If you have a 32-bit version of Windows, stop. Go to `Installing cvxopt`_.

    - Install the Python 2.7 64-bit version of `Anaconda <http://www.continuum.io/downloads#_windows>`_.
    - Install cytypesgen via ``pip install ctypesgen --pre`` (gpkit uses ctypesgen to interface with the MOSEK C bindings).
    - Download `MOSEK <http://mosek.com/resources/downloads>`_, then:
        - Follow `these steps for Windows <http://docs.mosek.com/7.0/toolsinstall/Windows_installation.html>`_.
        - Request an `academic license file <http://license.mosek.com/academic>`_ and put it in ``C:\Users\(your_username)\mosek\``
        - Make sure ``gcc`` is on your system path.
            - To do this, type ``gcc`` into a command prompt.
            - If you get ``executable not found``, then install the 64-bit version (x86_64 installer architecture dropdown option) of `mingw <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/>`_. 
            - Make sure the ``mingw`` bin directory is on your system path (you may have to add it manually).


Install GPkit
=============
  - Run ``pip install gpkit`` at the command line.
  - Run ``pip install ipywidgets`` for interactive control of models (recommended)
  - Run ``python -c "import gpkit.tests; gpkit.tests.run()"``
  - *Optional:* to install gpkit into an isolated python environment, install virtualenv, run ``virtualenv $DESTINATION_DIR`` then activate it with ``source $DESTINATION_DIR/bin/activate``


Debugging installation
======================

You may need to rebuild GPkit if any of the following occur:
  - You install a new solver (mosek or cvxopt) after installing GPkit
  - You delete the ``.gpkit`` folder from your home directory
  - You see ``Could not load settings file.``
  - You see ``Could not load MOSEK library: ImportError('$HOME/.gpkit/expopt.so not found.')``
To rebuild GPkit, do the following:
  - Run ``pip uninstall gpkit``
  - Run ``pip install --no-cache-dir --no-deps gpkit``
  - Run ``python -c "import gpkit.tests; gpkit.tests.run()"``
  - If any tests fail, email ``gpkit@mit.edu``


Updating GPkit between releases
===============================

Active developers may wish to install the `latest GPkit <http://github.com/hoburg/gpkit>`_ directly from the source code on Github. To do so,

  1. Run ``pip uninstall gpkit`` to uninstall your existing GPkit.
  2. Run ``git clone https://github.com/hoburg/gpkit.git`` to clone the GPkit repository, or ``cd gpkit; git pull origin master; cd ..`` to update your existing repository.
  3. Run ``pip install -e gpkit`` to reinstall GPkit.
  4. Run ``python -c "import gpkit.tests; gpkit.tests.run()"`` to test your installation.
