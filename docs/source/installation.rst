Installation Instructions
*************************

If you encounter any bugs during installation, please email ``gpkit`` at ``mit.edu``.

Mac OS X
========

1. Install Python and build dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  - Install the Python 2.7 version of `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_.
    - Check that Anaconda is installed: in a Terminal window, run ``python`` and check that the version string it prints while starting includes "Anaconda".
      - If it does not, check that the Anaconda location in ``.profile`` in your home directory (you can run ``vim ~/.profile`` to read it) corresponds to the location of your Anaconda folder; if it doesn't, move the Anaconda folder there, and check again in the ``python`` startup header.
  - If you don't want to install Anaconda, you'll need gcc, pip, numpy, and scipy, and may find iPython Notebook useful as a modeling environment.
  - If ``which gcc`` does not return anything, install the `Apple Command Line Tools <https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=command%20line%20tools>`_.
  - *Optional:* to install gpkit into an isolated python environment you can create a new conda virtual environment with ``conda create -n gpkit anaconda`` and activate it with ``source activate gpkit``.


2. Install either the MOSEK or CVXOPT GP solvers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  - Download `CVXOPT <http://cvxopt.org/download/index.html>`_, then:
      - Read the `official instructions and requirements <http://cvxopt.org/install/index.html#standard-installation>`_
      - In the Terminal, navigate to the ``cvxopt`` folder
      - Run ``python setup.py install``

  - Download `MOSEK <http://mosek.com/resources/downloads>`_, then:
      - Move the ``mosek`` folder to your home directory
      - Follow `these steps for Mac <http://docs.mosek.com/7.0/toolsinstall/Mac_OS_X_installation.html>`_.
      - Request an `academic license file <http://license.mosek.com/academic>`_ and put it in ``~/mosek/``
      - Run ``pip install ctypesgen --pre`` in the Terminal (gpkit uses ctypesgen to interface with the MOSEK C bindings)


3. Install GPkit
++++++++++++++++
  - Run ``pip install gpkit`` at the command line.
  - Run ``pip install ipywidgets`` for interactive control of models (optional)
  - Run ``python -c "import gpkit.tests; gpkit.tests.run()"``
  - If you want units support, install pint with ``pip install pint``.



Linux
=====

1. Install either the MOSEK or CVXOPT GP solvers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  - Download `CVXOPT <http://cvxopt.org/download/index.html>`_, then:
      - Read the `official instructions and requirements`_
      - In a terminal, navigate to the ``cvxopt`` folder
      - Run ``python setup.py install``

  - Download `MOSEK <http://mosek.com/resources/downloads>`_, then:
      - Move the ``mosek`` folder to your home directory
      - Follow `these steps for Linux <http://docs.mosek.com/7.0/toolsinstall/Linux_UNIX_installation_instructions.html>`_.
      - Request an `academic license file <http://license.mosek.com/academic>`_ and put it in ``~/mosek/``
      - Run ``pip install ctypesgen --pre`` (gpkit uses ctypesgen to interface with the MOSEK C bindings)


2. Install GPkit
++++++++++++++++
  - _Optional:_ to install gpkit into an isolated python environment, install virtualenv, run ``virtualenv $DESTINATION_DIR`` then activate it with ``source activate $DESTINATION_DIR/bin``.
  - Run ``pip install gpkit`` at the command line.
  - Run ``pip install ipywidgets`` for interactive control of models (optional)
  - Run ``python -c "import gpkit.tests; gpkit.tests.run()"``
  - If you want units support, install pint with ``pip install pint``.
  - You may find iPython Notebook to be useful modeling environment.



Windows
=======


1. Install Python dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  - Install the Python 2.7 version of `Python (x,y) <https://python-xy.github.io/downloads.html>`_.
    - Python (x,y) recommends removing any previous installations of Python before installation.
    - Make sure to check the cvxopt checkbox under "Choose components" during installation.


2. (optional) Install the MOSEK GP solver
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  - CVXOPT is included with Python (x,y) and does not need to be installed
    - Installing CVXOPT with Anaconda or another Python distribution can be difficult, which is why we reccomend Python (x,y).

  - Download `MOSEK <http://mosek.com/resources/downloads>`_, then:
      - Follow `these steps for Windows <http://docs.mosek.com/7.0/toolsinstall/Windows_installation.html>`_.
      - Request an `academic license file <http://license.mosek.com/academic>`_ and put it in ``~/mosek/``
      - To use the MOSEK C bindings solver:
        - Make sure "gcc" is on your system path (that is, you can type ``gcc`` into a command prompt and not get "executable not found")
        - Run ``pip install ctypesgen --pre`` in the Command Prompt (gpkit uses ctypesgen to interface with the MOSEK C bindings)


3. Install GPkit
++++++++++++++++
  - Run ``pip install gpkit`` at an Anaconda Command Prompt.
  - Run ``pip install ipywidgets`` for interactive control of models (optional)
  - Run ``python -c "import gpkit.tests; gpkit.tests.run()"``
      - If attempting to run the tests results in ``ValueError: Unknown solver ''.`` and ``python -c "import gpkit"`` prints "Could not find settings file", then run ``python -c "import gpkit.build; gpkit.build.build_gpkit()"``, to look for and install solvers. After doing so (it should say which solvers have been found), run     ``python -c "import gpkit.tests; gpkit.tests.run()"`` again.
  - If you want units support, install pint with ``pip install pint``.
