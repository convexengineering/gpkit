(objective) adds +1 to the sensitivity of Wtotal_Aircraft
(objective) is Wtotal_Aircraft [lbf] 

Ⓐ adds +0.0075 to the overall sensitivity of Wtotal_Aircraft
Ⓐ is Wtotal_Aircraft <= 0.5*CL_Mission/Climb/AircraftDrag/WingAero_(0,)*S_Aircraft/Wing/Planform.2*V_Mission/Climb_(0, 0)**2*rho_Mission/Climb_(0, 0) 

Ⓑ adds +0.0117 to the overall sensitivity of Wtotal_Aircraft
Ⓑ is Wtotal_Aircraft <= 0.5*CL_Mission/Climb/AircraftDrag/WingAero_(1,)*S_Aircraft/Wing/Planform.2*V_Mission/Climb_(0, 1)**2*rho_Mission/Climb_(0, 1)
