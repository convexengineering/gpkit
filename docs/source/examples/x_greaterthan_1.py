"Very simple problem: minimize x while keeping x greater than 1."
from gpkit import Variable, Model

# Decision variable
x = Variable("x")

# Constraint
constraints = [x >= 1]

# Objective (to minimize)
objective = x

# Formulate the Model
m = Model(objective, constraints)

# Solve the Model
sol = m.solve(verbosity=0)

# print selected results
