Solves with these variables bounded:
   value near upper bound: x
 sensitive to upper bound: x


Cost
----
 1e-30

Free Variables
--------------
x : 1e+30

Tightest Constraints
--------------------
    +1 : x <= 1e+30

sol['boundedness'] is: {'sensitive to upper bound': {x}, 'value near upper bound': {x}}
