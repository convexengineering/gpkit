    Lines that end in "Variables" will be parsed as a scalar variable table
    until the next blank line.

    Variables
    ---------
    A       [m^2]  surface area
    V   100 [L]    minimum volume

    Lines that end in "Variables of length $N" will be parsed as vector
    variables of length $N until the next blank line.

    Variables of length 3
    ---------------------
    s       [m]    side length

    Let's introduce more variables: (any line ending in "Variables" is parsed)

    Zoning Variables
    ----------------
    h     1 [m]    minimum height

    Upper Unbounded
    ---------------
    A

    The ordering of these blocks doesn't affect anything; order them in the
    way that makes the most sense to someone else reading your model.
