<DEBUG> Model is feasible with these modifications:

Arbitrarily Bounded Variables
-----------------------------
   value near upper bound of 1e+30: y
 sensitive to upper bound of 1e+30: y

Relaxed Constants
-----------------
  x_min [ft]: relaxed from 2 to 1

# Now let's try a model unsolvable with relaxed constants

<DEBUG> Model is not feasible with relaxed constants and bounded variables.
<DEBUG> Model is feasible with these modifications:

Relaxed Constraints
-------------------
   1: 3500% relaxed, from    x [ft] >= 1 [yd]
                       to 36Â·x [ft] >= 1 [yd]

# And one that's only unbounded

<DEBUG> Model is feasible with these modifications:

Arbitrarily Bounded Variables
-----------------------------
   value near upper bound of 1e+30: y
 sensitive to upper bound of 1e+30: y

<DEBUG> Model seems feasible without modification, or only needs relaxations of less than 1%. Check the returned solution for details.
