> Trying with bounded variables and relaxed constants:

Solves with these variables bounded:
   value near upper bound: y
 sensitive to upper bound: y

and these constants relaxed:
  x_min [ft]: relaxed from 2 to 1

>> Success!

# Now let's try a model unsolvable with relaxed constants

> Trying with bounded variables and relaxed constants:
>> Failure.
> Trying with relaxed constraints:

Solves with these constraints relaxed:
   1: 3500% relaxed, from x [ft] >= 1 [yd] 
                     to 36*x [ft] >= 1 [yd] 

>> Success!

# And one that's only unbounded
