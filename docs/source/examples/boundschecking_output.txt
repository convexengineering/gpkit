Constraints
-----------
 F >= D + T
 D = rf·V²·Ap
 Ap = nu
 T = mf·V
 mf >= mi + mb
 mf = rf·V
 Fs <= mi

 BoundsChecking.D has no lower bound, but would gain it from any of these sets: [(BoundsChecking.Ap, 'lower')]

BoundsChecking.nu has no lower bound, but would gain it from any of these sets: [(BoundsChecking.Ap, 'lower')]

BoundsChecking.Ap has no lower bound, but would gain it from any of these sets: [(BoundsChecking.D, 'lower')] or [(BoundsChecking.nu, 'lower')]
