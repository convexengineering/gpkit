Plotting a 1D Sweep
==================

A function called ``plot_sweep1d`` has been created to facilitate creating, solving, and plotting the results of a single-variable sweep (see :ref:`Sweeps` for details). Example usage is as follows:

.. literalinclude:: examples/plot_sweep1d.py

The result looks like:

.. literalinclude:: examples/plot_sweep1d_output.txt

.. figure:: examples/plot_sweep1d.png
    :align: center

.. figure:: examples/plot_autosweep1d.png
    :align: center
