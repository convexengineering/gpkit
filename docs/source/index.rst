GPkit is a Python package for defining and manipulating
geometric programming (GP) models.

The goal of GPkit is to make it easy to create, share, and explore geometric programming models, which tends to align well with being fast and mathematically correct.

GPkit abstracts away the backend solver so that users
can work directly with engineering equations and optimization concepts.
Supported solvers are
`MOSEK <http://mosek.com>`_
and `CVXOPT <http://cvxopt.org>`_.
