GPkit is a Python package for defining and manipulating
geometric programming (GP) models.

Our hopes are to bring the mathematics of Geometric Programming
into the engineering design process
in a disciplined and collaborative way, and to
encourage research with and on GPs by providing an
easily extensible object-oriented framework.

GPkit abstracts away the backend solver so that users
can work directly with engineering equations and optimization concepts.
Supported solvers are
`MOSEK <http://mosek.com>`_
and `CVXOPT <http://cvxopt.org>`_.
