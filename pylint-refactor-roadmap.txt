Goals:
 - make code compliant with latest version of pylint
 - minimize custom settings different than defaults

Plan:
 - move .pylintrc to backup file, to save previous custom settings
 - run pylint with default settings
 - fix as many errors as possible
 - as needed, roll previous custom settings back in for trouble spots
 - delete or dramaticlly simplify pylint.sh
